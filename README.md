# Rustplorer
Not very good name, but I don't really have any better idea for it.

# What is it?
Just a file explorer, like the one on windows but made in rust-lang.

# Is it functional?
kinda, still missing some features tho.

# Why?
No reason at all. I was just bored, not doing anything and I decided to code one.

# Contributions
Are welcomed!
